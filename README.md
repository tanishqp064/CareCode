💊 CareCode
I built this application as part of Mobile application and development subject in college as part of group project. 
CareCode is a simple Android application that helps users stay on top of their medication schedule. With an easy-to-use interface, users can add medicines and receive timely reminders.

🔔 Medicine Reminders: Set daily reminders for your medications.
